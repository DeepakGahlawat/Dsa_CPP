// question: -

// in this problem we have some objects with their price and their weight give to us and we have a knapsack or container with fixed
// capacity and we have to fill those object in that container so that we get the maximum profit

// **we can also take the objects in fraction

// in 0 - 1 knapsack we cannot take to fraction objects
